                        <p>The development for Metal Decor Studios started off fairly simple with collecting information on what they would 
                            like on the website, and setting up WordPress and installing plugins is fairly easy. However, the learning came 
                            in when I had to integrate PayPal with the WooCommerce plugin, and figuring out how taxes and shipping costs work 
                            in WooCommerce was a little bit of a challenge because the products he sells come in a variety of weights and sizes. 
                            So this issue really wasnâ€™t a development issue, but more of a business decision and setting up a variety of shipping 
                            methods. Another learning experience that came out of this was memory usage on shared hosting.</p>

                        <p>Since I took over WSFIA's website it has gone through 3 major versions, and all 3 have taken different approaches to make it 
                            easier to use for the association members. The first version was essentially a rehash of the old website, but with 
                            pdated code using just PHP and MySQL.</p>

                        <p>The second version was a complete overhaul using WordPress and PayPal. We went with WordPress in hopes to eventually have 
                            certain members take over the editing of most of the content, however I ended up doing most of the editing. In addition to 
                            the new look, I created a plugin for the membership login and registration, and conference registration in efforts to make 
                            those processes easier to use while using the WordPress framework and PayPal integration.</p>

                        <p>The third and current version is written in PHP, Node.js, and EJS for templating with PayPal integration. Also, it is hosted 
                            on the Google Cloud Platform. This gave me essentially free reign to learn and try new things to improve their website.</p>

                        <p>I know the website doesn't look like much, however I needed to really simplify the processes.</p>

                        <p>Eventually, WordPress was found to be cumbersome for the client, and involved duplicating work between WooCommerce 
                            and Square. So to alleviate the problem of the duplication of work we pointed the domain to Square, and this 
                            allows the client to enter all of the product information into only one area.</p>

                            viewing and editing privileges.</p>

                        <p>This project was built from the database on up. I started with laying out the database schema using Draw.io to 
                            make a basic Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and then created SQL files in the project's database directory 
                            that could be imported into the database. These SQL files also contained test data that I could use throughout 
                            the development process.</p>

                        <p>Another consideration for this project was "mobile first". One of the goals for this application was to run on 
                            phones and tablets, so I incorporated Bootstrap CSS to make it easier for the application to adjust to certain screen sizes.</p>
