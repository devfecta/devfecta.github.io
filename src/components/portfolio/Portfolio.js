                    like on the website, and setting up WordPress and installing plugins is fairly easy. However, the learning came 
                    in when I had to integrate PayPal with the WooCommerce plugin, and figuring out how taxes and shipping costs work 
                    in WooCommerce was a little bit of a challenge because the products he sells come in a variety of weights and sizes. 
                    So this issue really wasnâ€™t a development issue, but more of a business decision and setting up a variety of shipping 
                    methods. Another learning experience that came out of this was memory usage on shared hosting.</p>

                    <p>Since I took over WSFIA's website it has gone through 3 major versions, and all 3 have taken different approaches to make it 
                    easier to use for the association members. The first version was essentially a rehash of the old website, but with 
                    pdated code using just PHP and MySQL.</p>

                    <p>The second version was a complete overhaul using WordPress and PayPal. We went with WordPress in hopes to eventually have 
                    certain members take over the editing of most of the content, however I ended up doing most of the editing. In addition to 
                    the new look, I created a plugin for the membership login and registration, and conference registration in efforts to make 
                    those processes easier to use while using the WordPress framework and PayPal integration.</p>

                    <p>The third and current version is written in PHP, Node.js, and EJS for templating with PayPal integration. Also, it is hosted 
                    on the Google Cloud Platform. This gave me essentially free reign to learn and try new things to improve their website.</p>

                    <p>I know the website doesn't look like much, however I needed to really simplify the processes.</p>

                    <p>What needs to be done is pull data from sensors using webhooks into a database. Then transform the data by calling methods, 
                    written in PHP and Vanilla JS, to return calculated data points that will then be displayed in a graph in a website/web app.</p>
