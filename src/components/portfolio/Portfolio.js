                    handle Apache and PHP, and the other to handle MySQL. Also, I had to reconfigure the domain to point to the server and 
                    install an SSL certificate.</p>

                    <p>The development for Metal Decor Studios started off fairly simple with collecting information on what they would 
                    like on the website, and setting up WordPress and installing plugins is fairly easy. However, the learning came 
                    in when I had to integrate PayPal with the WooCommerce plugin, and figuring out how taxes and shipping costs work 
                    in WooCommerce was a little bit of a challenge because the products he sells come in a variety of weights and sizes. 
                    So this issue really wasnâ€™t a development issue, but more of a business decision and setting up a variety of shipping 
                    methods. Another learning experience that came out of this was memory usage on shared hosting.</p>
