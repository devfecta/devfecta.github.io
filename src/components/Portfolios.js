                        <a href="https://wsfia.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wsfia.org</a>
                        <p>Since I took over WSFIA's website it has gone through 3 major versions, and all 3 have taken different approaches to make it 
                            easier to use for the association members. The first version was essentially a rehash of the old website, but with 
                            pdated code using just PHP and MySQL.</p>

                        <p>The second version was a complete overhaul using WordPress and PayPal. We went with WordPress in hopes to eventually have 
                            certain members take over the editing of most of the content, however I ended up doing most of the editing. In addition to 
                            the new look, I created a plugin for the membership login and registration, and conference registration in efforts to make 
                            those processes easier to use while using the WordPress framework and PayPal integration.</p>

                        <p>The third and current version is written in PHP, Node.js, and EJS for templating with PayPal integration. Also, it is hosted 
                            on the Google Cloud Platform. This gave me essentially free reign to learn and try new things to improve their website.</p>

                        <p>I know the website doesn't look like much, however I needed to really simplify the processes.</p>

                        <p>Kinergetics wants to be able to show their customers real-time sensor data to their customers. This is a work in progress,

                        <p>What needs to be done is pull data from sensors using webhooks into a database. Then transform the data by calling methods, 
                            written in PHP and Vanilla JS, to return calculated data points that will then be displayed in a graph in a website/web app.</p>

                        <p>Sunset Yarn started off as a Wordpress project that involves the setup of hosting and email service on Bluehost, 
                            and the moving of the domain name from the hosting service Hostway. Along with the setup of WooCommerce, 
                            and the integration of WooCommerce with the Square payment processing service.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, WordPress was found to be cumbersome for the client, and involved duplicating work between WooCommerce 
                            and Square. So to alleviate the problem of the duplication of work we pointed the domain to Square, and this 
                            allows the client to enter all of the product information into only one area.</p>

                        <p>AdHound was a project for media distribution professionals with a customizable advertisement placement tracking 
                            system, and also ad performance and accounting reports. I also needed to address the ability for media distribution 
                            professionals to assign multiple users/assistants under their account, and assign those users with specific 
                            viewing and editing privileges.</p>

                        <p>This project was built from the database on up. I started with laying out the database schema using Draw.io to 
                            make a basic Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and then created SQL files in the project's database directory 
                            that could be imported into the database. These SQL files also contained test data that I could use throughout 
                            the development process.</p>

                        <p>Another consideration for this project was "mobile first". One of the goals for this application was to run on 
                            phones and tablets, so I incorporated Bootstrap CSS to make it easier for the application to adjust to certain screen sizes.</p>
